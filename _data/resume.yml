  summary: >
        I am a computer scientist with four years of research experience since my undergraduate 
        program. I am a dynamic and ambitious person with a great passion for mathematics, computer 
        science, and machine learning. Currently, I hold a Junior Fellow Research position in 
        DeepARC and Scientific Computing Group, where I am working on promising machine 
        learning projects. My current focus is Reinforcement Learning because I consider it the 
        most natural, formal, and robust way to define artificial intelligence. Recently I was in 
        an internship position at KAUST, where I improved my analytical, programming, and research 
        skills in the companion of masters and doctoral students. Additionally, this year, I was 
        part of various workshops and summer schools, which reinforced my basic knowledge and 
        improved my interpersonal skills. Regarding my professional life, in the last year, 
        I held the position of Machine Learning Engineer at DIGEVO company in Santiago, Chile.
