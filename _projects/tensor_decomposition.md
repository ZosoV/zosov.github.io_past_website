description: >
    This work introduces a new algorithm based on multilinear algebra for feature extraction, which later is plugged into a CNN to perform classification. During a single feed-forward step, we generate the  kernels  for  a  CNN architecture  by  computing  the covariance tensor of the data and factorizing it by Tucker decomposition.
