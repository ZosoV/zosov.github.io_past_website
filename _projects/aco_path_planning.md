description: >
  The project aims to lay promising methods to deal with a fundamental path planning problem; overall, the project seeks to deal with the stuck conditions in path planning problems. Stuck conditions are prevalent in this algorithm, averting the algorithm's convergence, mainly when the environment presents many obstacles. This work was part of my undergraduate thesis project.
