description: >
 In this work, we develop an entire process for an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system using mainly Nvidia TAO Toolkit, Nvidia Deepstream SDK, and Kafka. The video stream pipeline consists of three deep learning models, which work in a cascade style. First, tcn_net detects cars, then lpd_net detects license plates, and finally, lpr_net recognizes characters on the plates.
