description: >
    This work aims to intrinsically evaluate an ACO algorithm through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces this evaluation. We assessed our work in a single agent path planning problem because it guarantees a minimal contextualization of a decision-making problem for tracking dilemmas such as state and action spaces and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
