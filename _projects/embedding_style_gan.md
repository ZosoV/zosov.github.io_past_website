description: >
  This work aims to reproduce and study some fundamental algorithms to embed images into StyleGAN latent space. Also, it is intended to add further experimentations and review some post-processing operations, such as inpainting, super-resolution, colorization, morphing transformation, style transfer, and expression transfer.
