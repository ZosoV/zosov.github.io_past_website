<!--author-->

I'm a former B.Sc. student in Information Technology in the School of Mathematical and Computational Science, at Yachay Tech University.

I am a computer scientist with about four years of research experience from my undergraduate to the present. I consider myself a dynamic and ambitious person with a great passion for mathematics, computer science, and machine learning.  Currently, I hold a Junior Fellow Research position in DeepARC and Scientific Computing Group, where I am working on promising machine learning projects. My current focus is Reinforcement Learning since I consider it the most natural, formal, and robust way to define artificial intelligence. Currently, I am in the early stages of working on Reinforment Learning. I am going through websites on the topic and the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton, Andrew G Barto.

My research experience spans different areas of knowledge, which began with my research assistant positions during my undergraduate studies. However, in recent years my interest has focused on addressing machine learning problems. This is how recently I was in an internship position at KAUST, where I improved my analytical, programming, and research skills in the company of trained masters and doctoral students. Additionally, this year, I was part of various workshops and summer schools, which reinforced my basic knowledge and improved my international relations skills.

Regarding my professional life, in the last year, I held the position of Machine Learning Engineer at DIGEVO company in Santiago, Chile. Under the supervision of Omia AI Group, I started working as an intern, quickly becoming a full-time employee because of my programming skills and research experience.

Finally, something about my personality and hobbies: I consider myself an introverted person. However, this has not stopped me from meeting new people. I love meeting new people and living new experiences to share different worldviews of mine. I like to spend my time exploring research or technological news on my computer. I also enjoy playing video games or watching movies in my free time. However, I also enjoy going to the gym to maintain active my physical state.
