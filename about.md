I cofounded [DeepARC Research Group](https://www.deeparcresearch.com/) to deal with practical and fundamental artificial intelligence issues, supervised by [Eugenio Morocho](https://www.eugeniomorocho.com/). In addition, I currently hold a Junior Research Fellow position at [Scientific Computing Group](https://www.yachay-scg.com/) advised by [Israel Pineda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/israel-pineda/). My research interest relies on fundamental and practical Reinforcement Learning to reduce the gap between conceptual and real-world applications.

In March 2021, I worked as a research intern for six months at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia, where I developed research in Generative Adversarial Networks, particularly StyleGAN. I was fortunate to be advised by [Peter Wonka](http://peterwonka.net/).  From July 2020 to March 2021, I worked as a Machine Learning engineer at [Digevo](https://digevo.com/en/), Santiago de Chile, Chile. In March 2020, I received my B.Sc. in Information Technology focus on Computer Science from [Yachay Tech University](https://www.yachaytech.edu.ec/en/).

During my undergraduate, I researched different areas of knowledge. First, I worked in algebraic geometry when I implemented Wu's algorithm. After that, I developed an automatic survey generator system based on fundamental statistical methods. Lastly, I performed a project to find equidistant real roots using neural networks.

I enjoy spending my free time exploring technological news and investment opportunities. I am an enthusiastic investor. My hobbies are playing video games and watching movies.
