description: >
  This research intends to study the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and their theoretical and practical implications. I want to examine the learning process of fluid dynamic simulations to provide a realistic graphic simulation of complex physics. I believe that this will push forward the state of the art and that it is an invaluable asset to many scientific and engineering disciplines. Given this background, building on the existing work of Sanchez-Gonzalez, I will use a GAN architecture for the learning process.
